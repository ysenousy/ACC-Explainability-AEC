def distance_along_from_station(file: ifcopenshell.file, alignment: entity_instance, station: float) -> float:
    """
    Given a station, returns the distance along the horizontal alignment.

    If the alignment does not have stationing defined with an IfcReferent, the start of the alignment is assumed
    to be at station 0.0. That is, the station is the distance along.

    .. note:: The current implementation does not account for station equations and assumes stationing is increasing along the alignment.

    :param alignment: the alignment
    :param station: station value
    :return: distance along the horizontal alignment

    Example:

    .. code:: python

        alignment = model.by_type("IfcAlignment")[0] # alignment with start station 1+00.00
        dist_along = ifcopenshell.api.alignment.distance_along_from_station(model,alignment=alignment,station=200.0)
        print(dist_along) # 100.00
    """

    start_station = ifcopenshell.api.alignment.get_alignment_start_station(file, alignment)
    dist_along = station - start_station
    return dist_along
