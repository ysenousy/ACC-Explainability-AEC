    """
    Returns the geometric representation curve for an alignment.
    An alignment without layouts will have a curve of type IfcPolyLine or IfcIndexedPolyCurve
    A horizontal only will have a curve of type IfcCompositeCurve
    A horizontal+vertical will have a curve of type IfcGradientCurve
    A horizontal+vertical+cant will have a curve of tyep IfcSegmentedReferenceCurve

    Example:

        gradient_curve = ifcopenshell.api.alignment.get_curve(alignment)
